 - Provisioners autodetect settings where possible (httpd.conf etc)
 - Better handling of service worker in dev mode (pass env via postMessage and adjust behavior)
 - Better recognition of backend failure states (ECONNREFUSED etc)
 - Centralized config
 - TS definition files
 - Provisioner for Docker
 - Big refactor: Switch from Promises to Observables so that backend updates can push to dev environment
 - Browser interface option
